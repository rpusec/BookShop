# BookStop #

This is a simple online book shop application I built to teach myself AngularJS. The backend is written in pure PHP and the visuals are build with Bootstrap. 

### Requirements ###
 * PHP 5 >= 5.5.0 or PHP 7 (mostly because of password_confirm/verify functions)
 * The repository comes with a phpMyAdmin dump of the database. 

### Features ###
 * [UI-Router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) - to handle page-load without refreshes. 
 * [UI-Bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/) - set of native AngularJS directives with Bootstrap's markup and CSS.
 * [Notify.js](https://notifyjs.com/) - to provide stylized notifications.
